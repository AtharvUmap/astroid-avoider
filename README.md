# Astroid-Avoider
Made as a part of the Udemy Course, **Unity C# Mobile Game Development: Make 3 Games From Scratch.** 

This repository provides the implementation of an astroid avoider game on Unity. There is a spaceship that can move around and the goal is to stay alive as long as possible while dodging astroids that come out from the side of the screen in any direction. The longer you stay alive, the more points you gain.
